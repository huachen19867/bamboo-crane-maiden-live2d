"""Stage 5 — Physics. Procedurally generate pendulum physics for hair/cloth.

Each ``PhysicsRig`` is a Live2D-style input->output pendulum: a driver parameter (head/body motion)
swings an output parameter (``ParamHairFront`` etc.) through a spring/damper. The corresponding
*output* parameters and their sway deformation are authored in ``rig.author_rig``; this stage just
wires the pendulums. We only emit a rig when both its driver and output parameters already exist, so
the result always satisfies the IRR's referential integrity.
