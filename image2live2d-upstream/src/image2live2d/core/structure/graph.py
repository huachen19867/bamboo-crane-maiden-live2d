"""RigGraph — the character's movable skeleton: each part's kinematic parent + anchor + dynamics.

This is the P1 backbone that ``author_rig`` / ``generate_physics`` consume instead of ad-hoc role
scans (see docs/AUTORIG_PHYSICS_UNIVERSAL_PLAN.md). A ``RigGraph`` is built from the parts + meshes
(+ optional per-part dynamics from :mod:`.dynamics`); each ``RigNode`` records which structural group
a part rides (``"head"`` / ``"body"``) and where it attaches, so downstream stages parent motion
generically rather than enumerating roles.

Kinematic parenting is intentionally the *same rule* the rig used before (head-role parts ride the
head, body-role parts ride the body, an accessory binds to whichever group is nearest its attachment
point) so this can be dropped in with **no change to current output** — the first consumer just reads
the graph where it used to compute the split inline. Parenting here is mesh-based (no alpha), so it
stays usable in the pure pipeline; the alpha-based dynamics score is layered on by ``analyze_structure``
when textures are available.
