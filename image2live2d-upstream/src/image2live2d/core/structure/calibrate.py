"""P1b — calibrate the dynamics score against a corpus of pro Live2D models.

The dynamics detector (:mod:`.dynamics`) decides *which parts need physics* from geometry, but its
thresholds (``_DYNAMIC_T`` / ``_GENTLE_T`` / ``_FREE_EDGE_FLOOR``) encode a rigger's *taste* — a
judgment call. This module measures that judgment against ground truth. A professional
``.physics3.json`` states exactly which parameters the artist gave physics; point our scorer at the
same character, treat "verdict != rigid" as our prediction of "needs physics", and compare.

The interesting output is the **threshold sweep**: vary ``gentle_t`` / ``free_edge_floor`` and find the
values that best agree with the corpus, so the defaults in :mod:`.dynamics` can be tuned to real pro
work rather than guessed. Everything here is pure (no IO, no Pillow, no ML) so it is unit-testable with
synthetic parts; ``tools/calibrate_dynamics.py`` is the CLI that feeds it a local (gitignored) corpus
of real models.
