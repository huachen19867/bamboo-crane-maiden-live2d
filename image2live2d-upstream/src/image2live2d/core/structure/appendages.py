"""Appendage sway — dangling parts get secondary motion, driven by their kinematic parent.

Two planners share one ``AppendageSpec`` shape and one driver map:

* **accessories** (P4) — earrings, charms, ribbons, a hair bow, a waist tassel — already *follow* the
  head/body turn rigidly; P4 adds a gentle pendulum so the ornament **swings** as secondary motion,
  driven by whichever structural group the RigGraph bound it to (a head ornament with the head turn
  ``ParamAngleX``, a waist charm with the body ``ParamBodyAngleX``). Accessories are ornaments by role,
  so all of them are safe to give a bounded sway — no free-edge test needed.

* **garment appendages** (P4b) — a cape, a long sleeve, a coattail. These are ``clothing``, not
  accessories, and unlike a skirt hem they hang from the torso/shoulders, not the waist. The hard part
  is telling a *swingable* one from a rigid bodice/top: both are clothing. That is exactly what the P1
  dynamics score decides — a garment with a real **free edge** (a boundary that opens into void, not one
  glued to the torso) reads as ``gentle``/``dynamic`` and gets a body-driven pendulum; a bodice glued to
  the torso stays ``rigid`` and is left alone. The free-edge signal comes from the mesh silhouette
  (``analyze_meshes``), so this stays deterministic and Pillow-free. Skirt hems are owned by the skirt
  planner and excluded here.

Mesh-based throughout (no alpha PNG): the planners read the graph's parent + the part's mesh, so they
work in the pure pipeline and tests.

# ornament the body sway; a sleeve/cuff rides its ARM's articulation (swing about the shoulder as the
