"""Synthesise the inside of the mouth.

A decomposed mouth layer is only the *lip line* — on a real character it came out 21x6 px, 118 opaque
pixels: a thin closed-smile stroke. There is nothing behind it. So ``ParamMouthOpenY`` deformed the
lips correctly (the P5 lens: lower lip drops, upper lip rises, corners stay anchored) and yet the mouth
never *opened*, because parting a stroke over bare skin just reveals more skin. You cannot open a mouth
that has no interior.

Hand-drawn rigs get an inner-mouth layer for free — the artist paints the cavity (and often teeth and a
tongue) behind the lips. An auto-rigger has to make one. This module paints a cavity from the lip
line's own geometry and colour, inserts it as a part just under the lips, and lets the rig drive it:
collapsed to nothing while the mouth is shut (so a closed mouth is exactly the lip line it always was),
opening into a lens as ``ParamMouthOpenY`` rises.

Deliberately conservative:

* The cavity is **derived from the lip line**, never invented — its width, position and hue all come
  from the mouth layer's own pixels, so it cannot clash with the character's palette.
* It is **hidden at rest**. A rig whose mouth stays shut renders identically to one with no cavity at
  all, so this can never make a closed mouth look worse.
* If there is no mouth layer, or Pillow is unavailable, synthesis is skipped and the rig is unchanged.

# The cavity is sized from the mouth's WIDTH, never from the lip line's height. The height of a closed

#
# Aspect ratio ALONE was tried and is not enough: a closed smile with lip shading (an upper and lower
# lip, a soft curve) has a tall solid box too — measured aspect 0.41-0.69 on four test characters that
# are all plainly closed — so the aspect gate denied them a cavity and their mouths could not open (found
# by the capability report: 5 of 8 characters). What actually marks a drawn-open mouth is a genuine dark
# **interior cavity** — pixels much darker than the character's skin, a real oral shadow, not a light
# lip. So a mouth is "already open" only when it is BOTH tall AND has that dark interior: a closed smile
# (light interior, darkfrac ~0) gets its cavity; a true open mouth (dark cavity + teeth) is left alone.
# The threshold below started at 0.15, which a *dark-lipped closed mouth* trips: a lip drawn as a bold
# dark stroke over a lighter lower lip (the three hand-drawn Wikipe-tan characters) puts 0.17-0.25 of
# the box's solid pixels below the skin-relative cut, all of it the lip line, none of it an opening. So
# all three were judged "already open" and denied a cavity — their mouths could never open, and worse
# the capability report blamed "no interior behind the lips" when the truth was the opposite. Measured
# across all 13 corpus characters, every *closed* mouth caps at 0.245 (the dark-lipped ones) or sits at
# <=0.05 (the pale ones); a genuinely agape mouth is dominated by its interior shadow, well above that.
# 0.35 sits in that gap. It is also the safe side of an asymmetric cost: a *missing* cavity kills the
# open/close capability outright, while a cavity painted behind a mouth that really is agape is mostly
# occluded by the opaque open-mouth sprite — so when unsure, paint.
