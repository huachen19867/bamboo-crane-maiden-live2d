"""Stage 4 — Rig authoring. The hard part: turn layers+meshes into deformers + parameters.

Approach = **template-retargeting** (CartoonAlive's proven playbook). The base rung of the quality
ladder is **template-transfer**: for each standard Live2D parameter we synthesize keyforms by
applying a canonical deformation to whichever parts are present, scaled to each part's own mesh
bounding box.

The Phase 3 rung is **landmark-corrected** (``landmarks`` argument): when per-character landmarks are
available (from ``core.landmark.extract_landmarks``), deformations fit *this* character instead of a
generic bbox — head turn pivots on the real face oval, blink collapses along the true lid line, the
mouth keys off real corners, pupils travel within the real eye, and limbs rotate about real joints.
Every landmark feature degrades gracefully: absent landmarks fall back to the bbox heuristics, so the
function works with ``landmarks=None``.

What we author for a portrait:
* ``ParamEyeLOpen`` / ``ParamEyeROpen`` — blink (collapse the eye group toward its centre line).
* ``ParamMouthOpenY`` — open the mouth into a lens-shaped cavity (lower lip drops, upper lip rises a
  little, corners anchored), not a flat jaw-slide.
* ``ParamAngleX`` / ``ParamAngleY`` — head turn via a single **shared pseudo-3D spherical warp**
  applied coherently to every head vertex (features near the turn axis shift most; the receding
  edge foreshortens). This is the effect a Live2D warp deformer produces, baked into keyforms so it
  stays backend-neutral instead of relying on a nijilive-specific deformer node.
* ``ParamAngleZ`` — head tilt via rigid rotation about the head centre.
* ``ParamEyeBallX`` / ``ParamEyeBallY`` — pupil look (translate pupils).
* ``ParamBrowLY`` / ``ParamBrowRY`` — brow raise.

Most motion is baked as per-vertex mesh offsets in keyforms, which keeps it backend-agnostic (the moc3
and nijilive runtimes read only the mesh offsets). The one exception is the head turn: it is *also*
authored as a WARP ``Deformer`` (``deformers`` is no longer empty), carried in the ``deformer_offsets``
channel that only the editable-project (.cmo3) backend consumes — the two runtime backends synthesize
their own head turn and ignore it, so the .moc3/.inp are unchanged. See the head-turn note below.
