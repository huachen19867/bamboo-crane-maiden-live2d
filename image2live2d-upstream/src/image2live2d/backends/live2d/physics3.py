"""IRR ``Rig.physics`` -> Cubism ``.physics3.json`` (open JSON).

Each IRR ``PhysicsRig`` (a driver-param -> output-param pendulum) becomes one Cubism
``PhysicsSetting`` with an **Angle** input from the driver and an **Angle** output to the output
param, plus a 2-vertex pendulum (fixed root + swinging tip) whose mobility/delay/acceleration are
derived from the rig's mass/drag/length.

The exact swing feel (the tuning constants below) can only be judged in a Live2D runtime — like the
nijilive physics constants, these are first-pass values. The *structure* is what's verified here.

    **Pitch (…Y) is inert for a horizontal sway chain, and dropped there.** A "Y" input slides the
    pendulum's anchor straight *down its own string*, and the sway output is ``Type: "Angle"`` — an angle
    off the strand's rest direction. Sliding a pivot along the string it hangs from does not change that
    angle, so the input contributed exactly zero (``tools/physics_excite.py``: ``head_pitch`` moved 0 of
    8 sway chains), and neither Hiyori nor Akari emits a "Y" input.

    The honest fix for a nod-bounce is a *vertical* output param (``ParamHair*V``) on its own chain, fed
    pitch as an **Angle** input (``pitch_angle=True``): a nod tips the strand's gravity, so it swings and
    settles, and that swing maps to a straight-down hair drop. Tipping gravity is the one input that
    moves a down-hanging pendulum from a nod (validated in the simulator: Y peaks 0.0, Angle peaks 0.23
    and overshoots). Only the dedicated bounce chains set this; the sway chains still drop pitch.
