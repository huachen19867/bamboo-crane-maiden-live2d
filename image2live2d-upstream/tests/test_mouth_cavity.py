"""Synthesised inner mouth (core.synth.mouth + the ParamMouthOpenY rig).

A decomposed mouth layer is only the lip *line* — on a real character, 21x6 px of closed-smile stroke
with nothing behind it. ParamMouthOpenY parted the lips correctly and the mouth still never opened,
because parting a stroke over bare skin only reveals more skin. These pin that we paint an interior,
that it is invisible until the mouth opens, and that a rig without a mouth is left alone.
